      A person's favorite movies can reveal a lot about their interests,
      personality, and values. Films often reflect the kinds of stories, themes,
      and emotions that resonate with someone, offering insights into their
      tastes and preferences. For instance, someone who enjoys action-packed
      blockbusters might have a keen interest in adventure, excitement, or
      heroism, while someone who prefers indie films might appreciate deeper,
      more thought-provoking narratives.
